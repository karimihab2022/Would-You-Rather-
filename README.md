how to use the app?

1- clone the app
2- npm install
3- npm start

about the App

I added some extra functionalty to the App 

1- entring password when you are loging in "the password for the existing users is 123456" 
2- you can create new user "by entring username and name and password and upload avatar image from the computer if the user does not upload image 
    a random avatar is created to the user,handeling if the username is already taken 
3- you can edit your profile when you are loging in change(your name, your password, your avatar)  
4- when creating new question you have some rules
    1- you can't create question that its two options are the same
    2- you can't create question that is already created before
5-all the extra functionalty are managed by redux actions and updating the store states as the whole App(I needed some components state for the controlled components )    
6- all the extra functionalty are updating the backend as the whole App as I modified the _Data file as I added password key for the users
and added some functions like(formateuser,savenewuser,changeusername,..)that update the backend according to the actons.

hope to like the App and your feedback is importent for me.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
